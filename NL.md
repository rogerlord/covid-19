# The Netherlands

The datasets on which the below analysis is based are provided [here](https://data.rivm.nl/geonetwork/srv/dut/catalog.search#/metadata/2c4357c8-76e4-4662-9574-1deb8a73f724?tab=relations) on a daily basis by the [RIVM](https://rivm.nl/en), the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. The nowcasts could not have been possible without the repository of [Marino van Zelst](https://github.com/mzelst) and [Edwin van Veldhuizen](https://github.com/edwinveldhuizen) who keep a historical archive of the RIVM datasets [here](https://github.com/mzelst/covid-19/).

The below graph, which will be updated on a daily basis, shows the currently known reported infections for the last 30 days ("*Actual (not fully known)*"), the nowcast for the reported infections on a given date ("*Nowcast*"), as well as a 7-day rolling average of the number of reported infections (based on the nowcasts, "*Nowcast (7-day rolling average)*"). The nowcasts are generated by using a so-called Poisson chain ladder.

The next graph puts shows the 7-day rolling averages of the nowcast ("*Nowcast*") based on all information that is currently available, together with the past performance of the nowcast ("*Nowcast (same-day)*"), the gross reported number of positive tests ("*Gross*") as well as the actual data ("*Actual (not fully known)*").

The error of the (7-day rolling average of the) nowcast can be seen in the graph below, where the error of the nowcast for various parameters (β = 0 corresponds to equal weights for all observations, the higher the value of β, the more weight is placed on recent observations) is compared to the error of the gross reported number of infections.

Additionally, the below graph shows the reported number of infections in the last 7 days per municipal health region (*GGD regio*). As it is difficult to
adjust / forecast in regions where little to no infections are occurring, the measure used here is the gross increase in the reported infections. To put things into perspective - in Germany measures are imposed on a region if the number of reported infections in a 7-day period rises to the level of 50.0 or above.

Finally, the plot below has been inspired by [Marc Bevand](https://github.com/mbevand)'s heatmap of COVID-19 cases in Florida, which can be found [here](https://github.com/mbevand/florida-covid19-line-list-data). Each pixel represents a 1-day time period and age group. The intensity of each pixel indicates the
percentage of infections in that age group, relative to all cases reported on that day.
